I'm a fourth-year PhD student at the Mathematical Institute of [Utrecht University][UU], where my supervisor is [Sjoerd Dirksen][Sjoerd Dirksen]. My research is on the theory of machine learning. Specifically, I'm interested in the memorization capacity of neural networks and the properties of random neural networks. I'm always interested in computational aspects, too.

Before this, I studied mathematics at [RWTH Aachen University][RWTH], where I completed my master's thesis under the supervision of [Holger Rauhut][Holger Rauhut]. Since October 2023, I have sometimes helped to organize the [MI PhD Seminar][UU MI PhD Seminar] at Utrecht University.

In my free time, I enjoy building computers, most recently my home server. Right now, I'm learning about home networking and containerization and I'm thinking about exploring 3D printing soon.

## Teaching

As a teaching assistant I supervised exercise groups of students. Apart from this, I designed practical exam and homework exercises for *Introduction to Machine Learning* and supervised students one-on-one in the *Seminar on Machine Learning*. I assisted in all of the following courses:

- **Introduction to Probability Theory**\
Spring 2024, Spring 2023 and Fall 2021 at Utrecht University
- **Introduction to Machine Learning**\
Fall 2023, Fall 2022 and Spring 2022 at Utrecht University
- **Seminar on Machine Learning**\
Spring 2023 at Utrecht University
- **Programming for Mathematics**\
Spring 2022 at Utrecht University
- **Analysis**\
Spring 2024 and Spring 2021 at Utrecht University
- **Algorithms and Data Structures**\
Spring 2016 at RWTH Aachen University
