I'm a PhD student at the Mathematical Institute of [Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/) where I work under the supervision of [Sjoerd Dirksen](https://www.uu.nl/medewerkers/SDirksen). My research is concerned with the mathematical foundations of machine learning and in particular, I'm interested in the properties of (random) neural networks.

Currently, I'm working on data-dependent bounds for the memorization capacity of neural nets, see my recent [pitch talk](files/2022-12_aim.pdf).

Before coming to Utrecht, I completed an MSc in Mathematics at [RWTH Aachen University](https://www.rwth-aachen.de/go/id/a/?lidx=1).
